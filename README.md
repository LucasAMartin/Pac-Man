# Pacman Game

This is a C++ implementation of the classic Pacman game developed as a course project.

## Getting Started

To run the game, you will need a C++ compiler installed on your system. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, compile the source code using the following command:

Copy
g++ main.cpp -o pacman


After compiling, you can run the game by executing the `pacman` binary:

Copy

## Gameplay

The gameplay is similar to the original Pacman game. Use the WASD keys to move Pacman around the maze and collect all the pellets while avoiding the ghost. Collect all the pellets to win. Colliding with the ghost will end the game .
